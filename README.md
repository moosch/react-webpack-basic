# React Webpack Basic

Here is my super simple starter kit (I know, right? "Not another one!")

It has only the bare essentials of a React and Webpack project. Well, it also has Scss support. Why not?
Oh and some simple linting. Everyone loves beautiful code.

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/moosch/react-webpack-basic.git
cd react-webpack-basic
```

Install dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`

Once that's done you can build your project with running `npm run build`

Check your code is looking great with `npm run lint`
